 #Fluid Simulation with Hand Tracking â€“ TouchDesigner & JavaScript
This project explores fluid simulation controlled by hand gestures, combining creative coding and real-time interaction. Built using TouchDesigner with MediaPipe hand tracking and also prototyped in p5.js, the goal was to move beyond mouse input and create a more immersive, intuitive experience.
